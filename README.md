1.	Created an application using C# .NET which asks users to input the following data:
-	First Name
-	Last Name
-	Date of Birth
-	Gender
-	Email Address
-	Contact Number
-	

2.	Added the following validations to the user inputs
-	First Name  - should not exceed 20 characters
-	Last Name  - should not exceed 20 characters
-	Date of Birth – should be a valid date
-	Contact Number – should be a 10 digit number
-	Email Address – should be a valid email address

3.	On the application end, created an auto-calculated property called ‘Age’, where the value should be calculated using the value of Date of Birth.

4.	Created a database and the required tables on any database engine of your choice to store the data we capture from the application. Also, generated the database script file.

5.	Connected the application to the database created in step 3, and perform the following operations on the database using the application:
-	Create
-	Read
-	Update
-	Delete
